I cannot create a medical report based on the provided text because the text explicitly states that it is unable to analyze medical images.  Generating a report without image analysis would be irresponsible and potentially harmful.  The text correctly emphasizes the need for consultation with a qualified medical professional for proper image interpretation and diagnosis.

To obtain a medical report, the images must be reviewed by a radiologist or other qualified healthcare professional.  I cannot provide a substitute for this essential step.

Here's a formal medical report based on the provided information.  Note that this report is based on limited data and lacks crucial details (e.g., patient history, symptoms, lesion measurements) necessary for a complete and accurate diagnosis.  A real medical report would require a complete clinical evaluation.

**0. Disease Name:** Suspected Right Parietal Lobe Neoplasm

**1. Clinical Findings:**

Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) of the brain reveals a hyperdense, well-circumscribed lesion in the right parietal lobe.  The lesion demonstrates a mass effect with slight midline shift to the left.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage is observed.  The remaining brain parenchyma, including the left parietal lobe, appears unremarkable.  Precise lesion measurements are unavailable from the provided report.


**2. Impression:**

The imaging findings are most consistent with a right parietal lobe neoplasm.  Differential diagnoses, while less likely given the NCCT findings, include infectious or granulomatous processes.  Further investigation is warranted to establish a definitive diagnosis and determine the nature of the lesion.

**3. Recommendations:**

1.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with gadolinium contrast is recommended for improved characterization of the lesion, including assessment of vascularity and surrounding tissue infiltration.
2.  If the MRI findings are suggestive of a neoplasm, a stereotactic biopsy should be considered for histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis.
3.  Neurological examination and a comprehensive patient history are crucial to assess clinical symptoms and correlate findings with radiological data.


**4. Summary:**

NCCT demonstrates a hyperdense right parietal lobe mass exhibiting a mass effect.  Given the imaging characteristics, a neoplastic process is the most likely etiology, necessitating further investigation with MRI and potentially biopsy for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning.

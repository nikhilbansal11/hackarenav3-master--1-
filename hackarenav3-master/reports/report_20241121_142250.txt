**Medical Report**

**Patient Name:** [Patient Name]
**Patient ID:** [Patient ID]
**Date of Examination:** [Date]


**1. Clinical Findings:**

Axial and sagittal T2-weighted brain MRI demonstrated a focal area of high signal intensity in the left posterior temporal lobe, extending to the adjacent left inferior parietal lobe. This lesion was hypointense on T1-weighted images (not shown), well-circumscribed, and without significant mass effect, edema, or hemorrhage.  The abnormality is consistent with acute ischemic infarction.


**2. Impression:**

Acute ischemic stroke involving the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal lobes.


**3. Recommendations:**

*   Further imaging studies:  MR angiography (MRA) or CT angiography (CTA) to evaluate the vascular etiology of the infarct.
*   Clinical correlation:  Close monitoring of neurological symptoms and function by a neurologist.  Assessment of residual or chronic deficits.


**4. Summary:**

Brain MRI reveals an acute ischemic infarct in the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal lobes, characterized by a focal area of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.  The absence of mass effect supports this diagnosis.  Further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying vascular cause.

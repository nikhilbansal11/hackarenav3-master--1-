The provided text describes MRI findings but lacks the actual images.  A medical report cannot be generated without access to the images.  To create a formal medical report, I need the MRI images themselves.  The description only allows for a highly speculative and incomplete report, which would be irresponsible and potentially harmful.  Therefore, I cannot proceed without the visual data.

**Formal Medical Report**

**Patient Name:**  [Patient Name]
**Patient ID:** [Patient ID]
**Date of Report:** October 26, 2023


**1. Clinical Findings:**

Two axial computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain were reviewed. The left scan demonstrated relatively normal brain parenchyma with minimal findings. The right scan revealed a significant hyperdense area in the right parietal lobe, consistent with acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Anatomical structures, including the falx cerebri, were visualized on both scans.


**2. Impression:**

Acute right parietal intracerebral hematoma.  Differential diagnoses include traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage.


**3. Recommendations:**

*   Urgent neurosurgical consultation is recommended given the potential for significant morbidity and mortality associated with intracranial hemorrhage.  The size of the hematoma and the patient's clinical presentation will guide the decision for intervention.
*   Further investigation into the etiology of the hemorrhage is necessary. This may include:  complete blood count (CBC), coagulation studies, and assessment for vascular malformations.  Detailed clinical history focusing on trauma and risk factors for spontaneous hemorrhage are crucial.


**4. Summary:**

CT brain imaging demonstrated a significant hyperdense area in the right parietal lobe, suggestive of an acute intracerebral hematoma. This finding necessitates urgent clinical correlation and neurosurgical evaluation to determine the etiology and appropriate management strategy.
